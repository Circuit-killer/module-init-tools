Some BUGs, grouped by the individual utilty
-------------------------------------------

modprobe
--------
	* BUG: We don't output deps correctly when calling --show-depends (-D)
	* REASON: show-depends sets a variety of individual flags but there's
	  no easy way for handle_module->insmod to know the difference between
	  these options or an actual "-D", so we skip out too early if we hit
	  command entries when processing a module. RHEL has a temp fix that
	  it will re-read the environment (which does have -D set) in insmod.
