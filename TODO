Some TODOs, grouped by the individual utilty
--------------------------------------------

build
-----
	* Fix "make dist" to build documentation.
	* Fix "make distcheck" at the same time.

global
------
	* Unify implementations of grab_module into one (depmod/modinfo).

depmod
------
	* Fix use of special list handling (e.g. add_search) to use lists.
	* Fix command line path and kernel version handling to detect files
	  (fix warning on absolute paths, use file access to verify file).
	* Convert functions do_module et al to use list functions as possible.
	* Rework symbol version checks on load_symbols into generic function.
	* Kill off the "map" files. They aren't really needed any more.

modprobe
--------
	* Kill off some of the legacy options.
	* Fix grab_elf_file_fd error handling for test-module/10alias.sh.
	* Enforce use of *.conf files in /etc/modprobe.d as filename extension.
	* Add a "depends" config file directive to obviate "install" hacks.
