PLEASE READ INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY.
THIS WILL DESTROY THE OLD MODUTILS FOR PRE-2.6 KERNELS!
THERE IS NO BACKWARDS COMPATABILITY.

1) If running for the first time, you might try to convert your old
   modules.conf to modprobe.conf automatically:

	./generate-modprobe.conf /etc/modprobe.conf

2a) If you want to install in /sbin:
	./configure --prefix= --mandir=/usr/share/man

2b) If you want to install in /usr/local/sbin:
	./configure

3) Now, build it:
	make
	make install

4) If you are using devfs, copy modprobe.devfs to /etc

5) You will need to run "depmod" for your new kernel, eg:

	depmod 2.5.50

6) If you want to hack on the source:
	autoreconf -i
	(or in full: aclocal -I m4 && automake --add-missing --copy && autoconf)

If this is all too complicated, I recommend getting and installing the
source rpm or debian package instead.
